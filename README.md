# Small_reinforcement_learning_project
an implementation of Faster R-CNN model. It does not work perfect but the model is definitely directionally correct. The datasets are not included but can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbaghbidi/human-faces-object-detection (for the faces), and here: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/ (for the dataset with bodies).
