# Implementation of Faster R-CNN
An implementation of the Faster R-CNN architecture. It does not work perfectly but the model is directionally correct. The datasets are not included but can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbaghbidi/human-faces-object-detection (for the faces), and here: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/ (for the dataset with bodies).
